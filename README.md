# default_credit_card
Predicting whether a customer will default on his/her credit card. This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification.

# PROPOSED SOLUTION
• A proposed solution for leveraging data analytics in addressing the credit card default prediction involves using data-driven insights to inform the banks
whether its default credit or not. This could include:
 # Data Collection and Integration:
• Gather historical data about the persons age, education, gender, bank statements, Marital status, History of past payment and repayments.
• Data Cleaning and Standardization:
• Ensuring data quality by cleaning, validating, and standardizing datasets to remove inconsistencies and errors. This step is crucial for accurate analysis
and interpretation.
# Descriptive Analytics:
• Analyzing historical data to understand past trends, patterns, and characteristics of the defaulting. This can help in identifying whether the person will
default his credit or not.
# Predictive Analytics:
• Developing models to forecast future Credit card default trends, including credible and non credible clients. Predictive analytics can aid in risk
management and decision-making for credit card issuing.
# Prescriptive Analytics:
• Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or other relevant
metrics.
